# myapp_react2

This is another demo app, made (again) just for fun!
It is based on the [first one](https://github.com/andrealacamera/myapp_react1)

Here I used the following packages|libs|things (new ones highlighted):

- CRA
- TailwindCSS
- React Router
- [**React Redux**](https://react-redux.js.org/)
